<h3>Keyboard Commands</h3>

<p>In addition to the toolbars and menus (drop-down and context menu),
VisualARQ commands can be run by typing the command name in the command line.</p>

<p>VisualARQ commands start with the <strong>prefix va</strong> followed by the command name. When you type the prefix (va), the command line will display a list 
of all VisualARQ commands.</p>

<p>To run a command from the command line, simply type the command name. The autofill function shows all command options that start with the letters you just entered.<br />
Finally, click to select the command from the command list.</p>


<p>The command line also shows the prompts and options of VisualARQ commands in 
brackets, as in Rhino:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The prompts are messages that guide you in a command, allowing you to execute an action or enter information.</li>
	<li>The command options change depending on the command functions. They offer alternative ways of using commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable an option, click on the option, or type the option name or shortcut letter (underlined) on the command line.</p>
<p>To end a command, press ENTER.</p>
