<h3>Welcome to VisualARQ</h3>
<h4>What is VisualARQ?</h4>

<p>VisualARQ is a plug-in that has been designed for Rhino users working in the architecture sector (architects, interior designers, developers, etc). It helps to boost the workflow and improve the efficiency of the design process, allowing the user to carry out a greater number of tasks within a single production environment. Therefore, it reduces the loss of time and information, a common problem when using different software programs and formats throughout the project.</p>

<p>VisualARQ is fully integrated in the Rhino interface and it offers a powerful editor that can be easily and rapidly used to create and modify parametric architectural objects. Likewise, it offers a series of architectural tools that make the design and documentation process simpler and more dynamic.</p>

<p>Unlike other products in the market, VisualARQ integrates intuitively in the Rhino design workflow with the shortest learning curve.</p>
