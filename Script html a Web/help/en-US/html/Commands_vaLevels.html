<p>The <strong>vaLevels</strong> command opens a dockable <strong>Level manager 
</strong>dialog box from which it is possible to create, delete and edit new buildings and levels.</p> 
<p> From the <strong>Level manager </strong>dialog box you can control each level
<strong>CPlane </strong>(construction plane), <strong>visibility</strong> and its <strong>Elevation </strong>and <strong>Cut Plane
</strong>values.</p>
<p>The <strong>Level manager </strong>dialog box is divided in two parts:
<ul>
	<li>A toolbar line with the following options: <strong>New Building, New Level, 
	Delete </strong>and<strong> Cut Plane visualization</strong>.</li>
	<li>The list of buildings and levels and their properties: <strong>CPlane
	</strong>(construction plane), <strong>On/Off </strong>visibility, <strong>Plan
	View</strong> visibility, <strong>Elevation </strong>value, <strong>Cut Plane
	Height</strong> value, <strong>Top Offset</strong> and <strong>Bottom Offset</strong> values.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h5>New building</h5>
<p>
<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Building.jpg" alt="New building"/></td>
	<td>Creates new buildings from which you can add levels. Each building has its own elevation value and 
	the elevation values of the contained levels are relative to that building.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>

<h5>New level</h5>
<p>
<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Level.jpg" alt="New level"/></td>
	<td>Adds a new level to a selected building. The new level will be automatically created above the upper existing level, and will have by default the same elevation value than the level underneath. 
	A building element must be created to create levels.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>

<h5>Delete</h5>
<p>
<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Delete.jpg" alt="Delete"/></td>
	<td>Deletes a specific level or building. This does not affect all Rhino and VisualARQ objects which are contained 
	within the deleted level or building. They remain in the same place.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>

<h5>Cut Plane</h5>
<p>The <strong>Cut Plane</strong> represents an invisible <em>horizontal section</em> 
<em>plane</em> 
that each level has, situated at a specific height from each level 
elevation. The Cut Plane button turns On or Off the <strong>Cut Plane</strong> 
of a selected level, in the active viewport. A building and a level must be created to enable the <strong>
Cut Plane</strong> status.</p>
<p>When the Cut Plane is turned On for a specific level in the active viewport, <em>
everything above the cutting plane of that level will NOT be displayed. </em></p>
<p>When the Cut Plane is turned On in <em>Top viewports</em>, the VisualARQ 
objects, such as doors, windows, stairs, etc... will show their 2D plan view graphic 
representation.</p>
<br/>

<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Cut Plane On.jpg" alt="Cut Plane On"/></td>
	<td><strong>Cut Plane On</strong>: the viewport shows the level sectioned according to 
	its Cut Plane 
	position.</td>

	visibility On/Off status).</td>
</tr>

	<td><strong>Cut Plane disabled</strong>: you need to select a level to 
	enable its Cut Plane status.</td>

<h5>CPlane</h5>
<p>
<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/CPlane.jpg" alt="CPlane"/></td>
	<td>The CPlane (construction plane) determines the plane elevation from 
	where you are working on. Click on any level CPlane icon to move the CPlane 
	into the elevation of that level in the active viewport.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>

<h5>On/Off</h5>
<p>
The level On/Off visibility status shows or hides the objects or parts of the objects 
situated between the current level Elevation, and the upper level Elevation 
(taking into account the Top and Bottom offset values).</p>

<div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/On.jpg" alt="On"/></td>
	<td>The level is visible and you can see objects or parts of the objects on this level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Off.jpg" alt="Off"/></td>
	<td>The level is not visible, and you cannot see objects or parts of the 
	objects on this level.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: in-between levels can't be hidden individually. When an 
in-between level is hidden, the rest of levels above will be hidden 
automatically as well.</p>

<h5>Plan View On/Off</h5>
<p>The Plan View displays the 2D representation of any level, in the CPlane 
(construction plane) of the active viewport. This 2D representation 
is not editable and only shows the sectioned objects in the selected level, according to 
the Cut Plane position in that level.</p>
<p><div class="value icon" >
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Plan View on.jpg" alt="Plan view on"/></td>
	<td>The selected level 2D representation is visible in the CPlane of the active viewport.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><img align="left" src="../images/Plan View off.jpg" alt="Plan view off"/></td>
	<td>The selected level 2D representation is not visible in the CPlane of the active 
	viewport.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>



<h5>Set Current Floor</h5>
<p>To set a specific level as the current floor in the active viewport, 
<strong>double click on level name</strong>. This operation will automatically put the CPlane 
onto the selected level and will turn this level on in case it was hidden.</p>

<h5>Elevation</h5>
<p>The Elevation  value tells the base height of each building or level and the 
position of a Construction plane relative to each Building or Level. It determines which part of the model corresponds to each level. <em>Elevation values on levels</em> are relative to building elevation height. The <em>building elevation</em> value is measured along the z-axis of the document.</p>

<p class="figureWithDescription">
<img alt="Elevation marks" src="../images/Left View 400.jpg" /><br/>
The elevation mark of current level appears highlighted.</p>

<h5>Cut Plane height</h5>
<p>The cut plane determines the elevation of the <em>horizontal section</em> of each floor; i.e., only the objects in that elevation or right under it are included in the representation.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When a viewport is turned into a VisualARQ Plan view 
mode, the display mode is changed into &quot;hidden&quot; mode and changes the 
viewport for the <strong>Top</strong><em> </em>view. As long as the Plan view 
mode is enabled, the viewport will show any selected display mode although you 
switch the level view.</p>

<h5>Top offset</h5>
<p>The top offset determines the value by which a level's upper limit is increased or decreased when hiding entire levels. This is especially useful when you hide the upper part of a building and want to hide also the upper slab of the last shown level. This value is irrelevant for the top level of a building and only affects viewports that have the Cut Plane off.</p>
<h5>Bottom offset</h5>

<p>The bottom offset determines the value by which a level's lower limit is increased or decreased when hiding entire levels. This is especially useful when you hide the lower part of a building and want to hide also the lower slab of the last shown level. This value is irrelevant for the bottom level of a building and only affects viewports that have the Cut Plane off.</p>
