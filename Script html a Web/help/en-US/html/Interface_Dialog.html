<h3>Insert Dialog Boxes</h3>

<p>The insert dialog boxes show the options for objects that are being inserted. They are only visible while a command is running.</p>
<p>The option panels can be expanded (displayed) or collapsed (hidden) by clicking 
on the small arrows located at the corners.</p>

Insert dialog box for the Wall object.
</p>

<p>The insert dialog boxes are divided in three or more sections: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The top section shows a list with the object styles available.</li>
	<li>The middle section(s) show the basic object insertion option.</li>
	<li>The lower section shows a preview -in plan view and perspective view- of the object to insert. No preview is displayed when this section is collapsed so that the program does not have to calculate it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Slab and Roof objects don't use the insert dialog box.</p>
