<p>VisualARQ includes a built-in IFC import and export plug-in, which makes it possible to exchange VisualARQ and Rhino models with other AEC softwares using IFC 2x3 files.</p>
<h4>What is IFC?</h4>
<p>The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format is a standard way of exchanging objects
 in the building industry to reduce loss of information when transmitting files between different applications.
</p>
<h4>Export to IFC</h4>
	
<li>Go to<strong> File &gt; Save as</strong> and save the model as an IFC file format.</li>
<p><strong>Export Options</strong>: click on the <em>Options...</em> button to open the <a href="Commands_IfcExportOptionsDialog.html">IFC Export Options Dialog</a> and assign IFC class properties to the existing layers in the document.</p>

<p>The <a href="Commands_IfcTag.html">IFC tag</a> panel allows you to assign IFC properties to the objects when they are exported to IFC.</p>

<h4>Import IFC files</h4>
	
<li>Open a new file (<strong> File &gt; Open...</strong>) and select the IFC file to import. Make sure you have selected the <em>IFC 2x3 Building Model (*.ifc)</em> file type, or <em>All compatible file types</em>.</li>

<h4>What kind of geometry and data does VisualARQ export to IFC?</h4>
<p>When a document is saved as an IFC file all VisualARQ architectural objects keep 
their information and can be further edited in the ouput AEC software platforms. 
The Rhino solids, surfaces and meshes are opened as independent mesh objects, unless they have had an specific IFC type assigned <a href="Commands_IfcTag.html">by object</a>, or <a href="Commands_IfcExportOptionsDialog.html">by layer</a>. 
Annotation objects such as texts, hatches or dimensions, are not exported to IFC.</p>
